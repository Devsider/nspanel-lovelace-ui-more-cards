NsPanel Lovelace UI is a Firmware for the nextion screen inside of NSPanel in the Design of [HomeAssistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/)'s Lovelace UI Design.

## Features

- Entities Page with support for cover, switch, input_boolean, binary_sensor, sensor, button, scenes, input_button and light
- Grid Page with support for cover, switch, input_boolean, button, scenes, and light
- Detail Pages for Lights (Brightness, Temperature and Color of the Light) and for Covers (Position)
- Thermostat Page 
- Media Player Card
- Screensaver Page with Time, Date and Weather Information

It works with [Tasmota](https://tasmota.github.io/docs/) and MQTT. 
To control the panel and update it with content from HomeAssistant there is an [AppDaemon](https://github.com/AppDaemon/appdaemon) App.

See the following picture to get an idea of the look of this firmware for NSPanel.

## TLDR
1. Install Tasmota to NSPanel
2. Install Berry Driver in Tasmota and setup MQTT
3. Flash Nextion Firmware
4. Install AppDaemon, setup MQTT and install Backend Application

## How It Works

The NSPanel has two components an esp32 which runs Tasmota in this project and the nextion display, which is controlled by the esp32 via serial.
This project contains a display firmware, which can be controlled over serial/mqtt. 
It's controlled by an AppDaemon Application, which crafts the required commands from your HomeAssistant Instance.

For more details on how the display firmware works see the [README File in the HMI Folder](HMI/README.md)

## Requirements

 - NSPanel
 - USB to Serial TTL Adapter
 - Running [Home Assistant Instance](https://www.home-assistant.io/installation/)
 - Installed [MQTT Broker](https://www.home-assistant.io/docs/mqtt/broker) alongside Homeassistant

## Installation - Home Automation Part (Home Assistant)

### Installing AppDaemon

The recommended backend application for this firmware is written in a python for [AppDaemon](https://github.com/AppDaemon/appdaemon). 
This means it requires a working and running version of AppDaemon.

The easiest way to install it is through Home Assistant's Supervisor Add-on Store, it will be automaticly connected to your Home Assistant Instance.

![hass-add-on-store](doc-pics/hass-add-on-store.png)

#### Add babel package to AppDaemon Container (Optional)

For localisation (date in your local language) you need to add the python package babel to your AppDaemon Installation.

![appdaemon-babel](doc-pics/appdaemon-babel.png)


### Installing Studio Code Server (optional, recommended)

You will need a way to edit the `apps.yaml` config file in the Appdaemon folder. 
Install Studio Code Server from Home Assistant's Supervisor Add-on Store to easily edit configuration Files on your HomeAssistant Instance.

### Installing HACS (optional, recommended)

HACS is the Home Assistant Community Store and allows for community integrations and
automations to be updated cleanly and easily from the Home Assistant web user interface.
It's simple to install the AppDaemon app without HACS, but keeping up to date requires
manual steps that HACS will handle for you: you will be notified of updates, and they
can be installed by a click on a button.

If you want to use HACS, you will have to follow [their documentation on how to install HACS](https://hacs.xyz/docs/setup/download).

### Installing AppDaemon Backend Application 

#### With HACS (recommended)

To install Lovelace UI Backend App with HACS, you will need to make sure that you enabled
AppDaemon automations in HACS, as these are not enabled by default:

1. Click on `Configuration` on the left menu bar in Home Assistant Web UI
2. Select `Devices & Services`
3. Select `Integrations`
4. Find `HACS` and click on `Configure`
5. In the window that opens, make sure that `Enable AppDaemon apps discovery & tracking`
   is checked, or check it and click `Submit`
6. If you just enabled this (or just installed HACS), you might have to wait a few minutes
   as all repositories are being fetched; you might hit a GitHub rate limit, which might
   then require you to wait a few hours for HACS to be fully configured. In this case,
   you won't be able to proceed to the next steps until HACS is ready.

Now, to install NSPanel Lovelace UI Backend with HACS, follow these steps:

1. Click on `HACS` on the left menu bar in Home Assistant Web UI
2. Click on `Automations` in the right panel
3. Click on `Explore & download repositories` in the bottom right corner
4. Search for `NSPanel`, and click on `NSPanel Lovelace UI Backend` in the list that appears
5. In the bottom right corner of the panel that appears, click on
   `Download this repository with HACS`
6. A confirmation panel will appear, click on `Download`, and wait for HACS to
   proceed with the download
6. The Backend Application is now installed, and HACS will inform you when updates are available

#### Manually

Installing the Backend Application manually can be summarized by putting the content of the
`apps/` directory of this repository (the `nspanel-lovelace-ui/` directory) into the `apps/`
directory of your AppDaemon installation.


## Installation - Home Automation Part (IoBroker)

If you are looking for an ioBroker Integration instead of HomeAssistant take a look into the [Readme](ioBroker/README.md) of the iobroker folder.
Thanks to [britzelpuf](https://github.com/britzelpuf) for this integration.

## Installation - NSPanel Part

This section describes how to free your nspanel from stock firmware and get it ready for Lovelace UI üéâ

### Flash Tasmota to your NSPanel

You need to connect to your nspanel via serial and flash the [tasmota32-nspanel.bin](https://github.com/tasmota/install/raw/main/firmware/unofficial/tasmota32-nspanel.bin) to your NSPanel.
Make sure to come back to this guide, before uploading the nspanel.be/autoexec.be files.
For more deatils see the [NSPanel Page of the Tasmota Template Repository](https://templates.blakadder.com/sonoff_NSPanel.html).

### Configure Tasmota Template for NSPanel

Configure the NSPanel template for Tasmota. (Go to Configuration and Configure Other and paste the template there, make sure to tick the activate checkbox)

![tasmota-template-config](doc-pics/tasmota-template-config.png)

You can use the following template or copy the one on the [Tasmota Template Repo Site](https://templates.blakadder.com/sonoff_NSPanel.html).

`{"NAME":"NSPanel","GPIO":[0,0,0,0,3872,0,0,0,0,0,32,0,0,0,0,225,0,480,224,1,0,0,0,33,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4736,0],"FLAG":0,"BASE":1,"CMND":"ADCParam 2,11200,10000,3950 | Sleep 0 | BuzzerPWM 1"}`

After a reboot of tasmota your screen will light up with the stock display firmware.

### Setup your MQTT Server in Tasmota

Configure your MQTT Server in Tasmota.
See Tasmota [MQTT Documentation](https://tasmota.github.io/docs/MQTT/) for more details.

![tasmota-mqtt-config](doc-pics/tasmota-mqtt-config.png)

### Upload Berry Driver to Tasmota

1. Download the autoexec.be berry driver from the latest release. (Development Version [Berry Driver from this Repository](tasmota/autoexec.be))

2. Go to `Consoles` > `Manage File System` in Tasmota and upload the previously downloaded file.

3. Restart your NSPanel

### Flash Firmware to Nextion Screen

#### Use your own Webserver

Upload the nspanel.tft from the lastest release to a Webserver (for example www folder of Home Assistant) and execute the following command in Tasmota Console. (Development Version: [tft file from HMI folder](HMI/nspanel.tft))

**Webserver must be HTTP, HTTPS is not supported, due to limitations of berry lang on tasmota**

`FlashNextion http://ip-address-of-your-homeassistant:8123/local/nspanel.tft`

#### Use my webserver

Due the limitations of Berry, it's not possible to download the tft file directly from github, so I'm also renting a small server where you can download the file via HTTP.

The following Link has always the latest version from this repository, just execute the following Command in Tasmota:

`FlashNextion http://nspanel.pky.eu/lui.tft`

## Configuration

### Configuring the MQTT integration in AppDaemon

For the app to work you need a working MQTT Configuration in AppDaemon. Please add the configuration of your mqtt server, user and password to your existing `appdaemon.yaml`

```yaml

          - delete
      - type: cardMedia
```

## How to update

Updating involves mainly already descriped steps from installation, so this is a short summary.

This project has three main parts, on a new release you usally need to update at least two of them, the AppDaemon Backend and the firmware of the display.
Sometimes there are also changes to the berry driver script on tasmota.

*Note the commands in the following section will update to the current development version of this repository, use the command from release page if you want to use a release version*

### Update AppDaemon Script

HACS will show you that there is an update avalible and ask you to update.

### Update Display Firmware

Use the following command to update or use your own webserver. FlashNextionFast will use Nextion Upload Protocol 1.2 and try to skip unchanged parts of the firmware.

`FlashNextionFast http://nspanel.pky.eu/lui.tft`

In case this Update failes, reboot tasmota and use the following command:

`FlashNextion http://nspanel.pky.eu/lui.tft`

### Update Tasmota Berry Driver

Since release 1.1 you can update the berry driver directly from the Tasmota Console with the following command.

`UpdateDriverVersion https://raw.githubusercontent.com/joBr99/nspanel-lovelace-ui/main/tasmota/autoexec.be`



## FAQ - Frequently Asked Questions

### Flashing of the Display Firmware with FlashNextion doesn't work

1. Make sure to use the [tasmota32-nspanel.bin](https://github.com/tasmota/install/raw/main/firmware/unofficial/tasmota32-nspanel.bin) Tasmota build.
2. Make sure to use HTTP and **not HTTPS**

### My flashing doesn't start at all

Try to send the FlashNextion command a second time.

### My flashing got interrupted and the loading bar does not longer change.

Reboot Tasmota and try to flash it a second time.

### Waiting for content - This is taking longer than usual on the screen

Please check your MQTT Topics in your apps.yaml and your mqtt configuration on tasmota.
