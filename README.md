NsPanel Lovelace UI is a Firmware for the nextion screen inside of NSPanel in the Design of [HomeAssistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/)'s Lovelace UI Design.

**EU Model and US Model supported (in portrait and landscape orientation)**

Content of the screen is controlled by a AppDaemon Python Script installed on your HomeAssistant Instance.

Or an TypeScript on your ioBroker Instance in case you are an ioBroker User.

NsPanel needs to be flashed with Tasmota (or upcoming with ESPHome)

## Features

- Entities Page with support for cover, switch, input_boolean, binary_sensor, sensor, button, number, scenes, script, input_button and light, input_text (read-only), lock, fan
- Grid Page with support for cover, switch, input_boolean, button, scenes, light and lock
- Detail Pages for Lights (Brightness, Temperature and Color of the Light) and for Covers (Position)
- Thermostat Page 
- Media Player Card
- Alarm Control Card
- Screensaver Page with Time, Date and Weather Information
- Card with QrCode to display WiFi Information
- Localization possible (currently 38 languages)
- **Everything is dynamically configurable by a yaml config, no need to code or touch Nextion Editor**

It works with [Tasmota](https://tasmota.github.io/docs/) and MQTT. 
To control the panel and update it with content from HomeAssistant there is an [AppDaemon](https://github.com/AppDaemon/appdaemon) App.

See the following picture to get an idea of the look of this firmware for NSPanel.

## Installation - Home Automation Part (Home Assistant)

This section describes the Installation Steps for HomeAssistant, follow each step.

<details><summary>1. Installing HomeAssistant Add-Ons</summary>
<p>

### Installing AppDaemon


The backend application for HomeAssistant is written in a python for [AppDaemon](https://github.com/AppDaemon/appdaemon). 
This means it requires a working and running installation of AppDaemon.

The easiest way to install it is through Home Assistant's Supervisor Add-on Store, it will be automaticly connected to your Home Assistant Instance.

![hass-add-on-store](doc-pics/hass-add-on-store.png)

#### Add babel package to AppDaemon Container (Optional)

For localisation (date in your local language) you need to add the python package babel to your AppDaemon Installation.

![appdaemon-babel](doc-pics/appdaemon-babel.png)


### Installing Studio Code Server (optional, recommended)

You will need a way to edit the `apps.yaml` config file in the Appdaemon folder. 
Install Studio Code Server from Home Assistant's Supervisor Add-on Store to easily edit configuration Files on your HomeAssistant Instance.

</p>
</details>

<details><summary>2. Installing HomeAssistant Community Store</summary>
<p>

### Installing HACS

HACS is the Home Assistant Community Store and allows for community integrations and
automations to be updated cleanly and easily from the Home Assistant web user interface.
It's simple to install the AppDaemon app without HACS, but keeping up to date requires
manual steps that HACS will handle for you: you will be notified of updates, and they
can be installed by a click on a button.

If you want to use HACS, you will have to follow [their documentation on how to install HACS](https://hacs.xyz/docs/setup/download).

</p>
</details>

<details><summary>3. Installing Lovelace AppDaemon Backend Application </summary>
<p>

### Installing AppDaemon Backend Application 

To install Lovelace UI Backend App with HACS, you will need to make sure that you enabled
AppDaemon automations in HACS, as these are not enabled by default:

1. Click on `Configuration` on the left menu bar in Home Assistant Web UI
2. Select `Devices & Services`
3. Select `Integrations`
4. Find `HACS` and click on `Configure`
5. In the window that opens, make sure that `Enable AppDaemon apps discovery & tracking`
   is checked, or check it and click `Submit`
6. If you just enabled this (or just installed HACS), you might have to wait a few minutes
   as all repositories are being fetched; you might hit a GitHub rate limit, which might
   then require you to wait a few hours for HACS to be fully configured. In this case,
   you won't be able to proceed to the next steps until HACS is ready.

Now, to install NSPanel Lovelace UI Backend with HACS, follow these steps:

1. Click on `HACS` on the left menu bar in Home Assistant Web UI
2. Click on `Automations` in the right panel
3. Click on `Explore & download repositories` in the bottom right corner
4. Search for `NSPanel`, and click on `NSPanel Lovelace UI Backend` in the list that appears
5. In the bottom right corner of the panel that appears, click on
   `Download this repository with HACS`
6. A confirmation panel will appear, click on `Download`, and wait for HACS to
   proceed with the download
7. The Backend Application is now installed, and HACS will inform you when updates are available

## Installation - Home Automation Part (IoBroker)

If you are looking for an ioBroker Integration instead of HomeAssistant take a look into the [Readme](ioBroker/README.md) of the iobroker folder.
Thanks to [britzelpuf](https://github.com/britzelpuf) for this integration.




## Installation - NSPanel Part

This section describes how to free your nspanel from stock firmware and get it ready for Lovelace UI üéâ 

You only need to do one **Tasmota** OR **ESPHome**

<details><summary>Installation Instructions for Tasmota (Recommended)</summary>
<p>

### Flash Tasmota to your NSPanel

You need to connect to your nspanel via serial and flash the [tasmota32-nspanel.bin](https://github.com/tasmota/install/raw/main/firmware/unofficial/tasmota32-nspanel.bin) to your NSPanel.
Make sure to come back to this guide, before uploading the nspanel.be/autoexec.be files.
For more deatils see the [NSPanel Page of the Tasmota Template Repository](https://templates.blakadder.com/sonoff_NSPanel.html).

### Configure Tasmota Template for NSPanel

Configure the NSPanel template for Tasmota. (Go to Configuration and Configure Other and paste the template there, make sure to tick the activate checkbox)

![tasmota-template-config](doc-pics/tasmota-template-config.png)

You can use the following template or copy the one on the [Tasmota Template Repo Site](https://templates.blakadder.com/sonoff_NSPanel.html).

`{"NAME":"NSPanel","GPIO":[0,0,0,0,3872,0,0,0,0,0,32,0,0,0,0,225,0,480,224,1,0,0,0,33,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4736,0],"FLAG":0,"BASE":1,"CMND":"ADCParam 2,11200,10000,3950 | Sleep 0 | BuzzerPWM 1"}`

After a reboot of tasmota your screen will light up with the stock display firmware.

### Setup your MQTT Server in Tasmota

Configure your MQTT Server in Tasmota.
See Tasmota [MQTT Documentation](https://tasmota.github.io/docs/MQTT/) for more details.

![tasmota-mqtt-config](doc-pics/tasmota-mqtt-config.png)

### Upload Berry Driver to Tasmota

1. Download the autoexec.be from the repository: [Berry Driver](tasmota/autoexec.be)

2. Go to `Consoles` > `Manage File System` in Tasmota and upload the previously downloaded file.

3. Restart your NSPanel

### Flash Firmware to Nextion Screen

Note for ioBroker Users: Check the Release Notes, if the ioBroker Backend is not up to date with the current release there will be a note and you have to flash the latest compatible version from there.

#### Use your own Webserver

Upload the nspanel.tft from the lastest release to a Webserver (for example www folder of Home Assistant) and execute the following command in Tasmota Console. (Development Version: [tft file from HMI folder](HMI/nspanel.tft))

**Webserver must be HTTP, HTTPS is not supported, due to limitations of berry lang on tasmota**

`FlashNextion http://ip-address-of-your-homeassistant:8123/local/nspanel.tft`

#### Use my webserver

Due the limitations of Berry, it's not possible to download the tft file directly from github, so I'm also renting a small server where you can download the file via HTTP.

Use the one following commands to flash the latest release from this repository, just execute the following Command in Tasmota:

EU Version: `FlashNextion http://nspanel.pky.eu/lui-release.tft`

US Version Portrait: `FlashNextion http://nspanel.pky.eu/lui-us-p-release.tft`

US Version Landscape: `FlashNextion http://nspanel.pky.eu/lui-us-l-release.tft`

</p>
</details>

<details><summary>Installation Instructions for ESPHome</summary>
<p>

Support for ESPHome is WIP, see this third-party [ESPHome component](https://github.com/sairon/esphome-nspanel-lovelace-ui) which allows using ESPHome instead of Tasmota.

</p>
</details>



## Configuration

### Configuring the MQTT integration in AppDaemon

For the app to work you need a working MQTT Configuration in AppDaemon. Please add the configuration of your mqtt server, user and password to your existing `appdaemon.yaml`

NOTE: This are not the options of the AppDaemon Addon in HomeAssistant. You will find this file under: `config/appdaemon/appdeamon.yaml`

```yaml

Specify colours as red green and blue values from 0-255 e.g. `[255, 0, 0]` for red or `[0, 0, 255]` for blue. These are translated internally to RGB565 (note that this has lower color depth so the colours may not appear the same). Also note that the screen has a low contrast ratio, so colors look sigificantly different at full display brightness and lowest brightness.

#### Schedule sleep brightness

It is possible to schedule a brightness change for the screen at specific times.

```yaml
    sleepBrightness:
      - time: "7:00:00"
        value: 10
      - time: "23:00:00"
        value: 0
```

```yaml
    sleepBrightness:
      - time: "sunrise"
        value: 10
      - time: "sunset + 1:00:00"
        value: 0
```


#### Override Icons or Names

To override Icons or Names of entities you can configure an icon and/or name in your configuration, please see the following example.
Only the icons listed in the [Icon Cheatsheet](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/joBr99/nspanel-lovelace-ui/blob/main/HMI/icon-cheatsheet.html) are useable.

```yaml
        entities:
          - entity: light.test_item
            name: NameOverride
            icon: lightbulb
```

#### Fahrenheit on cardThermo
```yaml
      - type: cardThermo
        entity: climate.example_item
        temperatureUnit: fahrenheit
```
#### Subpages

You can configure entities with with the prefix `navigate`, that are navigating to cards, in case it's hidden card, the navigation items will change and the arrow is bringing you back to the privious page.

```yaml
          - entity: navigate.cardGrid_testKey
```

will allow you to navigate to a cardGrid page with the configured key testKey

```yaml
    hiddenCards:
      - type: cardGrid
        title: Exmaple Grid
        entities:
          - entity: light.test_item
        key: testKey
```

#### Change behaviour of hardware buttons

##### Tasmota Rules

You can configure the buttons to mimic an UI element on the screen by configuring tasmota rules.

The following rule will change the behaviour of the two buttons to do page navigation.

```
Rule2 on Button1#state do Publish tele/%topic%/RESULT {"CustomRecv":"event,buttonPress2,hwbtn,bPrev"} endon on Button2#state do Publish tele/%topic%/RESULT {"CustomRecv":"event,buttonPress2,hwbtn,bNext"} endon

Rule2 1
```

##### Decouple buttons from controlling power outputs

If you do not want your NSPanel physical buttons to trigger the relays and prefer to have them as software configurable buttons, open the Tasmota console of your NSPanel and enter the following:
   
`SetOption73 1`
 
Your relays will now appear as switches in HomeAssistant and you can control your buttons by using automations:
   
   ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/57167030/169677954-5b811d12-dab8-4415-89aa-e4196732765e.png)

You may reverse this change by entering the following in the Tasmota console of your NSPanel:

`SetOption73 0`

Please note: Doing this will mean that if HomeAssistant is not working for any reason your buttons will not function correctly.


## How to update

Updating involves mainly already descriped steps from installation, so this is a short summary.

This project has three main parts, on a new release you usally need to update at least two of them, the AppDaemon Backend and the firmware of the display.
Sometimes there are also changes to the berry driver script on tasmota.

*Note the commands in the following section will update to the current development version of this repository, use the command from release page if you want to use a release version*

### Update AppDaemon Script

HACS will show you that there is an update avalible and ask you to update.

### Update Display Firmware

Use the following command to update or use your own webserver.
